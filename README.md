# DemoCalculatorCS2

This makes it easier to get the commands to listen to voice comms from demos in cs2. To use the calculator go into the demo and find the player slots by using the "spec_player x" command in the game console. Then input into the box the player numbers or paste the whole commands for the players you want to hear and click the button to get the commands to paste into the game console.
